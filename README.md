# QWOP AI
This repo contains the code for this video where I taught an AI to beat QWOP using genetic algorithms, NEAT, and imitation learning - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2usRyiB9Vs

The game needs to be run using `python3 host_game.py`

The models can be trained and tested using `python3 main.py`
The choice of whether to train/test and which method to use can be set in `utils.py` using the `TRAIN` and `METHOD` variables.
